You will need your own local LLM, I used Ollama
You will need to get project credentials from Google Cloud Console
You will need to also create you own template for how you want the data parsed with placeholders
Format it as you like and add these placeholders:

{{STUDENT_NAME}}
{{STUDENT_INFO}}
{{ACCOMMODATIONS}}
{{GOALS}}
{{SERVICES}}
{{NOTES}}
{{DATE}}
